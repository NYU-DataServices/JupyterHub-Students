    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This session is designed for students who need an introduction to Jupyter Notebooks and especially the JupyterHub environment, and an overview of the specifics of NYU's installation of JupyterHub that you are encountering in your class. It presumes you have at least a general familiarity with what a Jupyter Notebook does (if not, see our [guide to Notebooks](https://guides.nyu.edu/data_management/jupyter-notebooks)), but need more knowledge about in-depth aspects of Notebooks and features of JupyterHub such as submitting assignments using NBGrader. \n",
    "\n",
    "Among the goals are to teach:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Review \"need to know\" features of Jupyter Notebooks and JupyterHub, including its interface, understanding kernels and environments using NBGrader, filling in and submitting assignments, and shortcut commands. \n",
    " - Special aspects of NYU's JupyterHub instance to understand, particularly around resource allocation and managing files\n",
    " - Debugging and new features of JupyterHub 4.0\n",

    "### 1.1 Signing In and Using the Dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "JupyterHub is a system for serving up both shared and individual Jupyter Notebooks, plus assignment and debugging tools, to users via a browser-based interface. Your class environment can be accessed by visiting its URL and logging in with Single Sign On and your NetID login. If using a browser such as Chrome or if previously authenticated with a Google product on your browser using a login other than your NYU NetID account, you will need to log out and login at the class JupyterHub URL using your NetID Single Sign On.\n",
    "\n",
    "Signing in brings you to an option to select a \"general\" or \"troubleshooting\" instance. Select \"general.\" Once the system starts up, you will be taken to the JupyterHub dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the dashboard you can select **General** or **Troubleshooting Only**. Select General.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be presented with a Launcher tab and some tiled options in the main screen, and a file navigation pane to the right:\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Select the tile of the service you want. For example, for a new Python3 Notebook select Python3 (ipykernel) tile under the Notebook list (RStudio and Bash environments are available as well). New services will open in tabs in the main screen. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you need a refresher on the fundamentals of a Notebook and its concepts of cells, cell types, and running code, consult [this tutorial from Problem Solving with Python](https://problemsolvingwithpython.com/02-Jupyter-Notebooks/02.05-The-Jupyter-Notebook-Interface).\n",

    "JupyterHub has the means to navigate directories and folders on your system, starting with your home or root, using the file browser on the lefthand pand (click the stacked bullet list icon on the left if the browser pane does not appear. Until you populate your instance with files, you will see this folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>~/shared</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a directory that is read-only; instructors can add files for you here, you can open Notebooks and edit and run the code in the Notebook but cannot save it in order to modify the Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also see a folder called <code>~/class_materials</code> if your instructor is using Github integration to deliver materials."

    "## 3.0 Managing Files and Watching Memory Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Storage Limitations\n",
    "**Very Important!** Students are typically provisioned with 1 GB of storage on their JupyterHub instance. This can create limitations in how many (and of what size) files you can upload onto your JupyterHub system as raw data for your Notebooks and code to access. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that if you install packages on the fly (for example, installing using conda) for your code, that installation counts against your storage allotment. The better option for resource-needy packages is for instructors to create an environment for such needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, most instances are set up with 500 MB of RAM. If you exceed your RAM, your script will fail to run. Plan accordingly when writing your code cells to use approaches such as chunking data ingest so as to avoid causing your kernel to die.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Unzipping\n",
    "\n",
    "Uploading compressed files can be helpful when uploading a large number of small files all at once. However, students should consider not using compressed files to somehow save on space. The file will likely need to be uncompressed to be used on the system, eating up storage space. **Be sure you understand the size of an uncompressed set of files before uploading the compressed version and uncompressing it.** \n",
    "\n",
    "To uncompress an uploaded file, it is recommended to perform this work within a Notebook (for Python) or RStudio (for R) using one of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    " - <code>[ZipFile](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html)</code> (for Python)\n",
    " - <code>[unzip](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/versions/3.6.2/topics/unzip)</code> (for R)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Troubleshooting Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "If you accidentally fill your storage to the point where you cannot remove uploaded files, restart your JupyterHub instance in Troubleshooting mode. This will give your environment a small boost in storage so that you are able to remove the files or packages needed to unlock your instance."
